These Keras exercises showcase how easy it can be to create complex networks using a "blackbox" API. You will need Keras installed (included in the "NN course environment"); a larger server is ideal. In the v1 notebook, we push the simple network built in this course to the limit to get 92% accuracy. In the subsequent two notebooks we get up to 98% accuracy by adding layers to our basic network.
